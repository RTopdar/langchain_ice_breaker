# Vergil's Redemption (A Fusion of Dante's Inferno and Like a Prayer)

Verse 1:
In the heart of a forsaken land,
Where demons rule with their cruel hand,
Walks a man named Vergil, once a brother tame,
Now chasing shadows of his former flame.

Chorus:
(Vergil) Redeem your sins, let them all burn away,
(Vergil) Walk the path of righteousness, find your own way,
(Madonna) Like a prayer, when you call my name,
In this world of darkness, I'll be your flame.

Verse 2:
Through Inferno's gates and Styx's stream,
Seeking answers to his haunting dream,
A path that leads to his own damnation,
Or the chance for redemption from a new creation.

Chorus:
(Vergil) Redeem your sins, let them all burn away,
(Vergil) Walk the path of righteousness, find your own way,
(Madonna) Like a prayer, when you call my name,
In this world of darkness, I'll be your flame.

Bridge:
Demons whisper lies in Vergil's ear,
Temptation calls from the void so near,
But within his heart, a light does shine,
A glimmer of hope that he can find.

Chorus:
(Vergil) Redeem your sins, let them all burn away,
(Vergil) Walk the path of righteousness, find your own way,
(Madonna) Like a prayer, when you call my name,
In this world of darkness, I'll be your flame.

Outro:
Vergil stands at a crossroad, lost but not defeated,
Finding strength within his darkest feared,
The echoes of Madonna guide him through the night,
A path towards redemption in the pale moonlight.
